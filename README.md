# Bluetooth-controlled-obstacle-avoiding-gas-leakage-detection-bot-for-industrial-applications
A Bluetooth-controlled robot with obstacle avoidance and gas leakage detection for industrial safety applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
ðŸš€ A Bluetooth-controlled robot with obstacle avoidance and gas leakage detection for industrial safety applications.

This project is a **Bluetooth-controlled robot** that can navigate industrial environments while avoiding obstacles and detecting gas leaks. The bot is designed for **industrial applications**, ensuring safety by identifying hazardous gas leaks in real time.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Bluetooth Control:** Operate the bot using a mobile app .
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Uses ultrasonic sensors to navigate safely.
- **Gas Leakage Detection:** Equipped with a gas sensor (e.g., MQ-5) to detect harmful gases.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Sends alerts when gas levels exceed a threshold.
- **Autonomous & Manual Mode:** Can operate in both automatic and manual control modes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications
- Industrial safety monitoring
- Hazardous area inspections
- Smart factory automation
- Underground gas leak detection

## ðŸ”§ Components Used
